## About

OWIN-JS defines a standard framework for REST servers written for io.js, Node.js and application/device logic. It works with both HTTP and COAP servers, and can be a drop-in replacement for existing frameworks such as Connect/Express

OWIN-JS is a superset of the OWIN specifications for HTTP servers, supporting Node.JS enterprise-grade servers, browser-apps, and constained device implementations.

The goal of OWIN-JS is to decouple transport and device logic and, by being an open standard, stimulate the open source ecosystem of Node.js web application/device development tools, without ties to any one framework such as Connect, Express, Koa.js, IIS, node-coap etc. while supporting middleware written for existing frameworks.

OWIN-JS is a port of the [OWIN](http://owin.org) specification, but expands the REST philosophy to web servers, internet of things, etc.
